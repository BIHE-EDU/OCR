# Background and Strategic fit

Recognition of the text in scanned documents of older Persian writings is a challenging task, because of 
the properties of such scripts and the cursive property of Persian writings in general. As separate 
segmentation of Persian characters is much more difficult than in Latin and some other alphabets, 
using segmentation-free approaches are more useful in Persian OCR. In this project, one of such methods 
called the Generalized Hidden Markov Models (or gHMM) is used for the recognition of texts written 
in a specific Persian font, which was mostly used in older Persian documents and books.
