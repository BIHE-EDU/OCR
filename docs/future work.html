        <p>Some of the steps that can be done to improve the recognition accuracy of the OCR program implemented in this
            project are explained below. In addition to these potential improvements, for implementing a complete and
            reliable Persian OCR software application which can be used widely (especially for recognition of historical
            documents and books), many other complications should be addressed and the program should have many other
            features. For instance, it will be much better that an OCR application is capable of covering more different
            font sizes and font families, and it should be able to handle different page styles. Another worthy
            direction of research in relation to Persian OCR is the recognition of handwritten Persian writings, which
            introduces new complexities and variations.</p>
        <ul class="info-list">
            <li>The first way of improving the results of this OCR program is to collect and prepare more training data.
                As mentioned earlier in this document, the number of training pages used in this project was not enough.
                Although it is a time-consuming manual task, preparing a much larger body of training text not only makes
                language model probabilities and emission parameters more precise and stronger, but also helps to increase
                the stability in the recognition results. All the character classes should have a good minimum number of
                training character images.</li>
            <li>The features extracted from character images are the most important factors in recognizing the characters.
                In Persian OCR, using more structural features may improve the discriminative power of the recognition
                process. Some important structural features are the lines and curves of each character, and also information
                about the connected components, dots, links, branches, etc. Thinning the body of the characters and creating a
                thin skeleton of
                each character before the feature extraction process can help to increase the power of the structural
                features used.</li>
            <li>Using the Gaussian Mixtures technique is another way to improve the recognition results. In this method,
                firstly a clustering technique is applied to the training images of each character, in order to determine
                how the training feature vectors are distributed. Then for each cluster different emission parameters are
                computed and stored. In the recognition process, the distance function for measuring the closeness to a
                character image computes a weighted sum (or a mixture) of the emission parameters of the clusters of the
                class. This method helps to address the large variances in the training images of the characters, and
                improves the emission model of each character class.</li>
