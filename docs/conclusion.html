        <h3><a href="index.html">Conclusion</a></h3>
        <p>In this project, we implemented an OCR software program which is capable of recognizing the text in the
            scanned images of the documents written in a specific older Persian font. Hidden Markov Models (HMM) was
            used as the mathematical tool for modeling the character recognition problem, mainly
            because HMM helps to take advantage of both the language model and the emission distances in service of the
            recognition of characters. Also because Persian writings are cursive and thus the segmentation of text lines
            into characters is a complicated problem, we preferred to perform the character segmentation and the
            character recognition processes simultaneously. This combination of segmentation and recognition becomes
            possible by using the generalized Hidden Markov Models (gHMM).</p>

        <p>Language model probabilities and emission probabilities are the most important parameters used by gHMM for
            recognizing the best segmentation of characters and the best character sequence corresponding to a text line
            image. Therefore, these parameters should be prepared in the training process, before the OCR program can
            run. Language model probabilities, including transition and initial probabilities are trained using the
            appropriately type-written text version of the training document. For preparing the parameters used for
            computing emission probabilities, firstly the training character images of all the character classes are
            extracted from the scanned pages of the training document. This extraction of training character images is
            done by marking the boundaries of characters in line images and then running a simple program to extract and
            label each character image. After that, the emission parameters of all the character classes are computed
            and saved by extracting and aggregating the features of the training character images. The features used in
            this project for representing character images are mostly statistical features, which give information about
            the way black pixels are distributed in different regions of each character image.</p>

        <p>The input to the recognition process is the scanned images of the pages. Therefore, before starting the main
            recognition process, some preprocessing is done by the program on the page images. The skew of the pages are
            detected and corrected by testing some criteria on different rotations of each page and finding the best
            angle. Then, the bounding boxes of the text lines in each page are detected by comparing all the possible
            horizontal strips in the page with a trained pattern of text lines. These comparisons are done by using the
            horizontal projections of the text line boxes. The final step in the preprocessing stage is the elimination
            of white spaces from within and right and left sides of each line image.</p>

        <p>In the main character recognition process, the generalized version of the Viterbi algorithm is used to
            iterate over all possible segmentations and all possible character sequences for each segmentation in order
            to find the best characters for the line image. For the comparisons of different character sequences in the
            Viterbi algorithm, a joint probability (or a total distance) formula based on the HMM is used, which
            combines the emission and the language model probabilities. For computing emission probabilities (or
            emission distances), a distance function called MQDF is used, which uses the mean vector and the eigenvalues
            and eigenvectors matrices of a character class in order to compute the closeness of a character image to the
            class.</p>

        <p>After doing a training phase by using 25 training pages, a series of cross-validation tests were done in
            order to find the best values for the important variables and parameters of the program. The best result
            achieved in the final tests of the program was 85.5% accuracy in recognizing the true characters.
            Modifications in the program like using the length probabilities in the Viterbi total distance formula,
            scaling down the values of the emission distances, and using average distances in comparisons, all helped to
            improve the accuracy of the implemented OCR program. Also factors such as using a larger body of training
            data and reducing the size of the block lengths in the Viterbi algorithm are effective on improving the
            results of the program.</p>
